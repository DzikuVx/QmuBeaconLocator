# QmuBeaconLocator

QmuBeaconLocator stands for QuadMeUp Beacon Locator and is a part of QmuBeacon project which consists of:

* [QmuBeacon](https://github.com/DzikuVx/QmuBeacon) - radio beacon that can be installed on any device to be tracked (airplane, drone, car, person?). Uses [LoRa32u4](http://bit.ly/2nJv9dd) hardware by default. 
* [QmuBeaconLocator](https://github.com/DzikuVx/QmuBeaconLocator) - more advanced version based on ESP32 boards that can act as Beacon Locator and a beacon itself. Uses OLED display for UI and is designed to work with [TTGO LORA32 OLED](http://bit.ly/2BjG47d) board as well as other ESP32 based designs

# Required libraries

To compile QmuBeacon you will need some external libraries that are not part of this repository. Those are:

* [TinyGPS++](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus)
* [QmuTactile](https://github.com/DzikuVx/QmuTactile)

# Hardware

* [TTGO LORA32 ESP32 board](http://bit.ly/2BjG47d)
* [BN-220](http://bit.ly/2B8h5jV) or [BN-180](http://bit.ly/2VqHuSF) or [BN-880](http://bit.ly/2OxW5by) GPS module
* [1S 3.7V LiIon battery](http://bit.ly/2Up7TnE)
* Any 868/915Mhz antenna
* 2 [tactile buttons](http://bit.ly/2UqsWpY)

# Instruction manual

1. Each board is assigned unique 32-bit BeaconID during the first boot. 
1. BeaconID can be regenerated by setting EEPROM at address `0x00` to value different than `0xf1`
1. Current vesion uses only push **LEFT** button connected to `GPIO0` on ESP32 boards
1. Long press cycles between device functions
1. Short press cycles between active beacons in `Locator` mode
